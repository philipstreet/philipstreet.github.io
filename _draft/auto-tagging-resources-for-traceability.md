Ever looked at a bunch of resources in a resource group in the Azure Portal and wondered, "What code repository do I need to modify to fix the issue with those resources?!". Well, there are some tagging frameworks for Terraform that will help you to answer those questions. So, let's take a look at the options and how you can use them.

## What tagging framework options are there for Terraform?

There are two main frameworks that I've found that you can use:

- [Yor](){:target="_blank"} by [env0](https://www.env0.com/){:target="_blank"}
- [Terragrunt](https://www.terratag.io/){:target="_blank"} by [bridgecrew](https://bridgecrew.io/){:target="_blank"}

Both frameworks will scan Terraform code and add tags to resources that it finds, but they provide different capabilities. So, let's dive into what each one can do.
